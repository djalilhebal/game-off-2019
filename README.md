# S. Gress (Game Off 2019)

CONCEPT ONLY. My entry for the [Game Off jam](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2019)

## Interpretation

Theme: **Leaps and Bounds**

Definitions:
* Leap:
  - A leap year
  - A jump

* Bound:
  - A boundary
  - A great leap/jump

This gives us: **Jumping from a leap year to another, after jumping over obstacles and breaking boundries.**

## Gameplay

Our genderless character _S. Gress_ mysteriously \[TBD\] comes into existence at the non-existent year 0 B.C. (maybe How To Play level?).  
Gress can only explore **leap years** (levels), and **progresses** in each level by **jumping** (as in, _a platformer_) through the stage.  
At each stage there will be hints to a specific scientific or socioeconomic limitation in humanity's knowledge; the game symbolizes/represents this limitation as a physical obstacle at the end of the level (read, **boundry**) that the player needs to break in order to open the way for Gress to make a **great jump** to the next level/year.

The player breaks these boundaries by guessing and googling the problem (with the help of visual/textual hints), and typing the 'event' that happened in that given year that changed the situation or overcome the problem (see examples).

---

- Maybe about 20 levels exit, highlighting 20 important leap years/events in the recent human history. The goal is reaching present day's "level of consciousness" (this has a _New Age_ vibe to it lol).

- S. Gress = **S**cientific/**S**ocioeconomic Pro**gress**

### Example 1
SETTING: 'Gress' jumps into the 1859\* stage. _(\* it's not a leap year but just go with it)_

SCENE: A giraffe has a short neck. This giraffe follows the player as they progress through the level. The giraffe stretches its neck to reach trees that get taller and taller. The giraffe stops at the boundary of the stage, blocking it with its neck.
(this is a famous example of Lamarck's theory of evolution)

  |              *    
  |              *    
  |              *    
  |              *    
  | Gress     Giraffe 
  .-------------------

```

SOLUTION: "On the Origin of Species" or "Darwinina Evolution" stops the giraffe's neck's length that was acquired during its lifetime, from being passed from parent to offspring.
At the end of the level, there won't be any boundary. Now you can make your 'bound' to the next stage. Happy, humanity is progressing scientifically!

  |              *    
  | Gress     Giraffe 
  .-------------------

```

### Example 2
SETTING: 1984 was a leap year.

SCENE: Gress jumps over rising and falling bars (of a chart, of course) that change as news headlines (text, appearing from a radio or a newspaper). Bars have persons' names. Headlines read something like, "FACEBOOK ACQUIRES COMPANY-X", "FACEBOOK FACES LEGAL CHARGES", "SCANDAL ON FACEBOOK", etc...
The bars near the boundary (or maybe just anywhere along the way), you can't jump over the last bar because it's either too high or the previous bars are very low.

SOLUTION: Mill's Principles of Political Economy as in

> Up to Mill’s time, partners shared full liability for losses, including any personal property they owned—obviously a strong deterrent to the founding of worker co-operatives.

## Disclaimer
I have no idea what I'm doing. I'm not really into history and not sure what events are really important and what actually caused some things to change (as in Example 2)
